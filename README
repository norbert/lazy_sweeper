= LazySweeper

This is one of the best solutions for the second hardest thing in CS. It is based on a post by the guys at Fingertips (1).

Have fun sweeping your entire page cache.

Add models by calling <tt>LazySweeper.observe</tt> in an initializer. You can also call <tt>LazySweeper.run</tt> manually if needed.

For more information, you can check the Rails Envy article on page caching (2) that also ripped the original code.
